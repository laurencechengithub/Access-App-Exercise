This is an exercise for retrieving JSON data from git API.

using Pods like: 'SwiftyJSON', 'Kingfisher'

simple MVVM code using closure with view model,

git documents regarding to pagination isn't helpful to me,

so I've tried to modify the URL instead.

Due to short of time, images for avatar detail page are there in green background

welcome for any code suggestion for a better way to do it.
